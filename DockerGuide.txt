Step one install Docker Dekstop + docker compose ( should come as default but just see if you will be asked if yes then install)

1. Clone Repository 
git clone < name of our repository > 
then cd into that folder 

2. Build & start the app 
Docker-compose up -d --build

This will generate containers for 

- PosteSQL DB working on port 5432 
- Backend container on port 5000
- Frontend service on port 3000

if the containers have not started type :

- docker-compose up -d

3. How to access the app 

You should be able to access: 

- Frontend on http://localhost:5000
- Backend Api : http://localhost:3000 

to stop services type docker-compose down

To check the logs 

docker-compose logs ( for all the logs ) 

docker-compose logs "name of the container " to generate logs for specific container


4. Accessing DB 

- docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres phishingdb
